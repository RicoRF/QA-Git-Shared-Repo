# Quality Assurance Git Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a project completed as part of the "Quality Assurance" course. The primary goal was to develop competencies in using Git for version control and collaboration. The project emphasized teamwork and applying key Git concepts such as commits, branches, merges, and conflict resolution.

The project itself involved building a simple static website featuring a car catalog. The site includes pages for different car models, a cart system, and an interactive layout. This allowed the team to practice version control while developing and maintaining a shared codebase collaboratively.

Grade Achieved: **98%**

## Project Objectives

1. **Practice Git Concepts**:
   - Understand and apply Git commands such as `clone`, `commit`, `branch`, and `merge`.
   - Manage changes effectively through pull requests and reviews.

2. **Team Collaboration**:
   - Collaborate with team members in a shared repository.
   - Resolve merge conflicts and maintain a clean commit history.

3. **Simulate Real-World Development**:
   - Work as part of a distributed team.
   - Follow best practices for version control and teamwork.

## Key Concepts Practiced

1. **Branching and Merging**:
   - Created feature branches for individual contributions.
   - Merged branches into the main branch after reviews.

2. **Commit Management**:
   - Wrote clear and meaningful commit messages.
   - Followed a structured commit history for traceability.

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Handled merge conflicts during collaborative development.
   - Ensured that conflicts were resolved effectively without data loss.

4. **Pull Requests**:
   - Used pull requests for integrating changes into the main branch.
   - Reviewed and approved code changes as a team.

## Repository Structure

- **Main Branch**:
  - Stable and production-ready code.
- **Feature Branches**:
  - Individual branches for team member contributions.
- **Merge History**:
  - Reflects a well-maintained commit log with resolved conflicts and reviews.
- **Static Website Files**:
  - `index.html`: Landing page for the car catalog.
  - `product1.html`, `product2.html`, `product3.html`: Pages for individual car models.
  - `cart.html`: Page to view selected cars.
  - `main.css`: Stylesheet for consistent design.
  - Image files: Photos of cars featured in the catalog.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RicoRF/QA-Git-Shared-Repo.git
   ```

2. **Explore branches**:
   - Use `git branch -a` to view all branches.
   - Switch to a specific branch using `git checkout <branch-name>`.

3. **View commit history**:
   - Use `git log` to see the commit history and details.

4. **Test collaboration**:
   - Simulate contributions by creating new branches and practicing merges.

5. **View the website**:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the car catalog.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand the repository with additional Git workflows like rebase.
- Introduce CI/CD pipelines to integrate quality checks.
- Document advanced Git commands for team usage.
- Add functionality to the website, such as a working cart system or backend integration.
